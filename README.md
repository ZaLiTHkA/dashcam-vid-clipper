## Media Tools - CLI Collection

my humble collection of specific use-case PowerShell scripts, unleashed upon the world for anyone to tinker with..

### Project Layout

take note of the following key files and folders:

* `bin/` contains the actual script files
* `docs/` contains documentation for the scripts files

### Scripts Index

..and yes, I am indeed starting out very small here:

* Video Clipper : [[script](bin/Video-Clipper.ps1)] [[docs](docs/Video-Clipper.md)]
