* `0-dashcam-source` are files copied directly from my dashcam SD card
* `1-rewrapped` are files rewrapped in a container with compression that Davinci Resolve can open
  * _note: the script that automates this is currently on my personal laptop, it will be shifted here shortly._
* `2-final` are files joined and/or trimmed as sharable edits
