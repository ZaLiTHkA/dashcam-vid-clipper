## Media Tools - CLI Collection

a collection of specific use-case PowerShell scripts, unleashed upon the world for anyone else to tinker with..

### Scripts Index

**take note**: these are not ordered in any special way, other than just the order in which they were added..

* [ ] [`vid-clip-concat.ps1`](docs/vid-clip-concat.md) - functional, needs refactoring

### Project Layout

* `bin` contains the actual script files
* `docs` contains documentation for the scripts files
* `test` contains supporting data for testing the script files

### Contributing

while this workspace is intended for PowerShell scripts, it is initialised as a Node project.. this is simply to allow
me to use `nodemon` to execute the scripts with live-reload, which is particular useful for the development phase.

> more details to come on this front later..
